## About
This simple Bot is created for lazy people like me. I dont want to open my Browser always when I want to check a price for my AWP | Asiimov or for my Knife. I can just copy&paste the name of needed Skin and check the current price in my Telegram window. 

## How to use it
If you don't want to install it, just add [@CSGOPrices_bot](https://telegram.me/CSGOPrices_bot) to your contacts. 
Then type /start and follow the simpliest insctrucion ever. 

You can type the name like this: 
AK-47 | Fuel Injector (Factory New) and get this: AK-47 | Fuel Injector (Factory New) - 90.91$
or like this: 
AK-47%20%7C%20Fuel%20Injector%20(Factory%20New). It does't metter.

I will add other ways to type a name, like "AK-47 Fuel Injector fn" later. Or you can help me to do this. :)
